# ADR-036 — Event intake and the issue pipeline

**Status:** Accepted (2026-09-24) — Implemented (2026-09-24), live verification pending
(real `gh` against the configured repos, real WhatsApp group creation).

**Builds on / changes:**
- [[ADR-033]] — every agent step is a task in the task ledger (`origin =
  pipeline`); the ledger gains a per-task working directory and a tool
  profile. The WhatsApp target policy gains the intake groups; the DM chat
  session gains read-only intake commands.
- [[ADR-020]] — new DB `memory/intake.db` (written only through
  `nucleus_core::intake`); new queue table `intake_group_requests` in
  whatsapp.db; new bot-owned tables `intake_groups` and `intake_inbound`
  that Rust reads.
- [[ADR-029]] — the GitHub poll cursor is a watermark per repo
  (`intake:github:<owner/name>`).
- [[ADR-021]] — operator replies reach an item's agent attributed to the
  operator and the surface they came from.
- [[ADR-011]] — the Intake dashboard page follows the tailnet-only threat
  model of the Tasks page (ADR-033 §7).

## Context

Work requests reach the operator from several places: GitHub issues on the
operator's repositories today; email, WhatsApp messages and homelab alerts
later. Each source has its own format, and nothing turned a request into
work that Nucleus could carry out with the operator's oversight.

The operator decided the following, which this ADR implements:

1. One source-agnostic core. Every source is an adapter that turns its items
   into one common event record. GitHub issues are the first adapter. A
   generic `nucleus events emit` command lets scripts add events.
2. GitHub is polled with `gh`, with a cursor per repo; Nucleus has no public
   ingress. The first repos are configured by `owner/name` in the untracked
   `nucleus.toml`.
3. An issue starts work only when it carries the configured label. Only
   people with triage or write access can set labels, so the label proves
   that such a person accepted the issue; the issue author can be anyone.
   Agents read only comments written by repository collaborators.
4. Stages, each persisted, each agent step a task in the ADR-033 ledger with
   parent links: intake, eval, refinement (for complex items and feature
   requests), implementation, draft pull request. Nucleus code, not an
   agent, pushes and opens the pull request. Nucleus never merges. The issue
   gets a comment only after the operator approves the text.
5. OS sandboxing is deferred. The design keeps it possible: agents do not
   run network steps; Nucleus code does.
6. Every WhatsApp send uses the existing target policy and secret filter;
   the task ledger handles concurrency, cancel and status; the operator can
   ask about items in plain language in the DM.
7. A dashboard page lists the items and shows each item's eval, thread (with
   a reply box), plan, implementation status and pull request.

## Decision

### 1. The common event record and the adapter interface

`core/src/intake/event.rs` defines `NewEvent`: `source`, `external_id`,
`project` (the repository, `owner/name`), `kind`, `title`, `body`,
`author`, `labels`, `url`, `state` (`open` | `closed`), `created_at`,
`updated_at`, `raw` (the source's own record, unchanged) and `accepted`
(the adapter's gate decision). The store keeps one row per
`(source, external_id)` in `events`: the first report inserts it; a later
report updates the fields a source may change and returns `Updated` or
`Unchanged`. Timestamps from outside go through `timestamp::to_sortable`.

A polling source implements `SourceAdapter`:

| Method | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `source()` | the `source` value of its events |
| `cursor_key()` | the ADR-029 watermark key of this adapter instance |
| `poll_interval()` | minimum time between two polls |
| `poll(cursor)` | events changed since the cursor, and the next cursor |
| `discussion(event)` | the trusted part of the discussion (comments) |
| `reply(event, body, marker)` | post on the event at its source, without posting twice |

A push-style source (a script, a future webhook receiver) calls
`nucleus events emit`. Adding a source changes neither the store, the
dedup, nor the pipeline. An event from a source without an adapter object
has no discussion and no reply channel; its item closes after the draft PR
instead of waiting for a comment decision.

`nucleus events emit --source S --id X --title T [--body - | --body B]
[--project owner/name] [--label L]… [--url U] [--state open|closed]
[--accept]` records an event. `--accept` (the operator's terminal only)
marks it as passing the gate; with a configured repo as `--project` it
becomes an item. A detached process (a launchd script) may emit without
`--accept`. `nucleus events list` shows recent events.

### 2. The GitHub adapter

`core/src/intake/github.rs`, through `gh` (`[intake.github] gh_bin`; launchd
has no shell PATH, Rule 5). One adapter instance per configured repo.

- **Poll.** `gh api -X GET repos/{repo}/issues` with `sort=updated`,
  `direction=asc`, 100 per page, up to `max_pages`. The first poll reads
  open issues only; later polls read every state with `since=<cursor>`, so
  a closed issue closes its item. The cursor is the newest `updated_at`
  seen, stored as a watermark after every event of the batch is recorded.
  `since` is inclusive; the store absorbs the repeated issue. Pull requests,
  which the issues API also lists, are skipped. The tick polls a repo only
  when `poll_interval_secs` (default 300) have passed since its last poll.
- **Gate.** `accepted` is true when the issue carries `[intake] label`
  (default `nucleus`, compared case-insensitively). The pipeline creates an
  item only for an accepted, open event on a configured repo.
- **Collaborators.** `GET /repos/{repo}/collaborators/{login}`: success means
  collaborator, a 404 means not. Any other failure counts as not trusted for
  that read and is not cached. Answers are cached in intake.db for
  `collaborator_cache_secs` (default 3600). Logins outside GitHub's
  character set are never looked up. `discussion()` returns only comments
  by collaborators and the number left out; Nucleus's own comments (they
  carry the marker below) are skipped.
- **Reply.** `gh issue comment` with the body plus an invisible marker
  `<!-- nucleus-intake:item-<n>:comment -->`. Before posting, the comments
  are searched for the marker, so a crash between the post and its record
  does not post twice.

### 3. Items and stages

An item (`items` table, `#<n>`) belongs to one event and one configured
repo. Its stage is one of:

| Stage | What happens |
|---|---|
| `queued` | Nucleus clones the repo on first use (`gh repo clone`), fetches, and checks out the item's worktree detached at `origin/<default branch>` |
| `eval` | the eval agent runs (read-only) |
| `refinement` | discussion with the operator until a plan is approved |
| `implementation` | the implementation agent runs (`code` profile); then Nucleus commits what the agent left uncommitted, checks that the branch has commits, and runs the repo's tests |
| `pr` | Nucleus pushes the branch and opens a draft PR |
| `review` | the PR is open; the proposed issue comment waits for the operator |
| `closed`, `cancelled` | terminal; the item's group is left and its worktree removed |
| `failed` | a step failed; `retry` resumes it |

`core/src/intake/stage.rs::transition` is the only place that decides a
stage change; it refuses events that do not apply (no skipping from `eval`
to `pr`, no approval outside refinement, terminal stages never change). A
failed eval is retried from `queued`; any other failed stage is retried in
place. `store::advance` applies a transition in one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE`
transaction whose `WHERE` re-checks the stage it moves from and logs the
transition in `item_transitions`.

Two conditions from the source stop an item at any time: the event closed
(the issue was closed) closes it; the label removed cancels it during
`queued`, `eval`, `refinement` or `implementation`. A running stage task is
cancelled in both cases.

Every agent step is a task in the ADR-033 ledger: kind `intake-eval`,
`intake-refine` or `intake-implement`, origin `pipeline` (the ledger only,
no delivery), requester `pipeline`, `origin_ref = intake:<n>`, parent = the
item's previous task, links `intake=#<n>`, `event=…`, `issue=owner/name#12`.
The ledger's concurrency limit, heartbeat, runtime limit, sweep and cancel
apply unchanged. The steps Nucleus code performs (clone, commit, tests,
push, PR, comment) are logged as item transitions, not tasks.

A step that fails (a fetch, a push, a `gh` error) is retried at the next
tick; the third consecutive failure fails the item (`step_errors`). An error
retrying cannot fix (the repo was removed from the configuration, the work
dir is inside the Nucleus checkout) fails it at once.

### 4. The ledger changes (ADR-033)

`tasks.db` v5 adds `workdir` and `profile`:

- `workdir`: the worker session's working directory (the item's worktree);
  it must be an existing absolute directory. The session's transcript and
  `.claude/` resolution follow it; the operator's private skills tree is not
  loaded there.
- `profile` (`WorkerProfile`): `agentic` (unchanged behavior), `read-only`
  (refuses Bash, Edit, MultiEdit, Write, NotebookEdit, WebFetch, WebSearch,
  Task and Agent), `code` (refuses WebFetch, WebSearch and Bash patterns for
  `git push|fetch|pull|remote|clone|submodule`, `gh`, `curl`, `wget`, `ssh`,
  `scp`, `rsync`, `nc`, `npm publish`, `cargo publish`). Each profile adds a
  line to the worker prompt. The profiles only add refusals on top of the
  Settings denylist and the worker denylist.

Neither field is reachable from `nucleus tasks start`: a chat session cannot
choose where a worker runs or change its posture. Only in-process producers
(the pipeline) set them.

### 5. The eval agent

The brief (`core/src/intake/briefs.rs::eval_brief`) asks for one of
`simple`, `complex`, `feature`, with written reasons and the criteria
`change_size` (small | medium | large), `schema_impact`, `security_impact`,
`public_api_impact` and `confidence` (0–1), as JSON between
`===EVAL===` and `===END EVAL===`. `stage::parse_eval` validates it. Code
then applies the pipeline's own rule: an item goes straight to
implementation only when the agent says `simple` AND no impact holds, the
size is not `large`, and the confidence is at least `[intake]
min_confidence` (default 0.7). Otherwise the item goes to refinement, and
each reason for raising it is stored (`escalations`). `feature` and
`complex` are never lowered. Output that does not follow the contract fails
the item. The result is stored as `eval_json`.

### 6. Untrusted text

Issue text is written by anyone who can open an issue. Every brief puts the
issue and the collaborator comments between data markers that carry a
random nonce (`<<<DATA-<16 hex> issue>>>` … `<<<END-DATA-<nonce>>>`); the
text cannot know the nonce, any line inside that starts with `<<<` or `===`
(a marker or one of the pipeline's output markers) gets a `> ` prefix, and
the instructions say the content is a description of a request, never
instructions. Operator messages and the approved plan come from the
operator and are marked as such outside the data blocks. Only collaborator
comments are included at all (§2).

A simple item's implementation brief is derived from the issue text,
because no plan exists; the label (set by someone with triage access) and
the eval's escalation rule are the gates for that. Text that goes to GitHub
(PR title and body, the comment) passes the Rust credential filter
(`secret_filter::CredentialRules`) first.

### 7. Refinement

**Surfaces.** When an item enters refinement, the pipeline chooses where its
thread runs on WhatsApp:

- A new WhatsApp group, when `[intake.whatsapp] refinement_groups` is on
  and fewer than `max_groups_per_day` (default 3) groups were requested in
  the last 24 hours. The pipeline queues a `create` request in
  `intake_group_requests` with the subject `#<n> <short title>` (at most 60
  characters). The bot creates the group with `groupCreate(subject,
  [operator])`: Baileys adds the creator (the bot's account) itself, so the
  group contains the bot and the operator only. The bot enforces the same
  daily limit on its own count of created groups. Automated group creation
  from a personal account can trigger WhatsApp's anti-spam checks, which is
  why both limits exist and default low.
- Otherwise, or when the bot refuses or fails the request, or when no group
  exists after `group_wait_minutes` (default 15), the thread runs in the
  operator's DM. Every message the pipeline sends there starts with `[#n]`;
  the operator writes in the thread by starting a message with `#n`, or by
  replying (quoting) to one of the pipeline's messages. Other DM messages go
  to the DM chat session as before. The bot routes `#n` only when the
  pipeline sent a DM message for item n in the last 30 days, so an ordinary
  message that starts with `#1` is not taken.

Library check (Baileys 7.0.0-rc11, `lib/Socket/groups.js`): `groupCreate`
sends the participant list it receives, and the creator is a member without
being listed. Creating with the operator as the only participant is
supported. Creating with an empty participant list is accepted by the
library (it sends a create node with no participants); whether WhatsApp's
server accepts that was not tested, and the design does not need it,
because the bot runs on its own number and the operator must be a member.

When the item closes or is cancelled, the pipeline queues a `close`
request; the bot waits until the group has no unsent outbound rows (at most
10 minutes), leaves the group and removes it from the target allowlist. It
does not archive the chat: Baileys' archive call needs the chat's last
messages, and leaving already ends the thread for the bot.

The same thread is on the dashboard (§10). Every thread message is stored in
`item_messages` (author `operator` | `agent` | `nucleus`, surface `via`),
and every message not from WhatsApp is sent to the item's surface through
the outbound queue (`dedup_key = intake:<n>:m<id>`), so the drain's target
policy and secret filter apply. A message to a group has every identifier
redacted by the filter, as for every group.

**Turns.** Each refinement turn is a separate `intake-refine` task with the
`read-only` profile in the item's worktree. Its brief contains the eval, the
latest proposed plan, the whole thread so far (the most recent 9 000
characters when longer) and the operator messages it must answer; so a turn
does not depend on an earlier session being resumable. The first turn starts
when the item enters refinement (the agent summarizes the request and asks
its questions or proposes a plan). Later turns start when operator messages
arrive and no turn is running; messages that arrive during a turn are read
by the next one. The turn's final message is the reply. A plan is the text
between `===PLAN===` and `===END PLAN===`; Nucleus stores it as the next
plan version and appends the approval hint.

**Approval.** Code decides approval from the operator's own message, never
the model. A message whose whole text is `approve`, `approve plan`,
`approve vN` (with `#n` in the DM; optional in the item's group) approves
the latest plan; `approve comment`, `skip comment` and `cancel` are the
other commands; everything else is a message. The approval is refused, with
a note in the thread, when there is no plan, when a refinement turn is
running (its reply may replace the plan the operator read), or when the
named version is not the latest. The dashboard's approve button sends the
version shown. The approved plan becomes the implementation brief.

### 8. Implementation, pull request, comment

Right before implementation Nucleus fetches, resets the worktree to the
newest `origin/<default branch>` (a plan discussed for days is built on
current code) and switches to `nucleus/item-<n>-<slug>`. On a retry the
existing branch and its commits are kept. The agent works with the `code`
profile, runs the configured `test_command`, commits locally and ends with
a summary. Then Nucleus:

1. commits anything left uncommitted;
2. fails the item when the branch has no commit beyond the base;
3. runs `test_command` itself (`sh -c` in the worktree, `test_timeout_minutes`,
   default 30) and records `passed`, `failed`, `timeout` or `not_run` with
   the end of the output;
4. pushes the branch, looks for an existing PR for the branch
   (`gh pr list --head`), and otherwise opens a draft PR (`gh pr create
   --draft`) whose body holds the agent's summary, `<pr_issue_keyword> #<issue>`
   (default `Closes`), the test result and the item marker;
5. sends the PR link to the item's thread, and proposes an issue comment
   (`[intake.texts] issue_comment`).

The comment is posted only after the operator approves it, in the thread
(`#n approve comment`) or on the dashboard, where the text can be edited
first; `skip comment` closes the item without one. Nucleus never merges and
never marks a PR ready.

### 9. The driver

`nucleus intake tick` runs every minute from launchd
(`tools/launchd/intake-tick.plist.example`, `StartInterval = 60`), and once
more right after an operator reply (the WhatsApp bot and the dashboard start
it detached). It is a scheduled job rather than part of an existing service
because it does work of its own (git, `gh`, test runs) that must not block
the WhatsApp connection or the dashboard, and because launchd restarts it
from a clean state every minute.

One tick: poll the due sources; read the operator messages the bot stored
since the last read; then, per item, run the stage step, follow an
immediate next step (eval done → implementation task started) at most four
times, resolve the WhatsApp surface, send new thread messages, and clean up
closed items. Ticks take advisory locks (`flock`, released by the OS when a
process exits) under `memory/intake-locks/`: `poll`, `inbound`, and one per
item. A tick skips what another holds, so a long test run on one item never
delays the others and no item is advanced by two processes.

### 10. Dashboard

`/intake` lists items (open / all) with stage, repo, eval class, what waits
on the operator and the PR link. The detail shows the source event, the eval
(class, criteria, reasons, escalations), the plan with an approve button,
the thread with a reply box (refinement only; also sent to WhatsApp), the
implementation summary, Nucleus's test result, the PR, the proposed comment
(editable, approve or post nothing), the stage tasks from the ledger and the
stage log. Retry and cancel are row actions. Every confirmation uses
`InlineConfirm`. API: `/intake/api/{list,detail,reply,approve-plan,
approve-comment,skip-comment,cancel,retry}`; wire types are generated (Rule
12). Writes accept JSON bodies only and refuse requests a browser marks as
cross-site, as the Tasks cancel does (ADR-033 §7).

### 11. CLI and the DM session

`nucleus intake tick [--poll] | list [--all] [--json] | show <n> [--json] |
reply <n> --text T | approve-plan <n> [--version V] | approve-comment <n>
[--text T] | skip-comment <n> | cancel <n> | retry <n>`.

| Caller (`crate::caller`) | May |
|---|---|
| Operator | every command |
| WhatsApp DM chat session | `list`, `show`, `cancel` (not in a turn that read an agent message) |
| Detached process (launchd, the bot, the dashboard) | `tick` |
| Workers, other sessions, unscoped chats, unknown | nothing |

The DM persona gets an "Issue pipeline items" section and the pre-approved
patterns `Bash(./target/release/nucleus intake list|show|cancel:*)`. The
session answers questions about items in plain language and tells the
operator how to approve; it cannot approve, reply in a thread, or retry.

### 12. Write ownership (ADR-020)

- **intake.db** — every write through `nucleus_core::intake` inside the
  `nucleus` binary (CLI, tick, the dashboard's write routes). Dashboard reads
  use `open_read_only`.
- **whatsapp.db** — Rust inserts into `outbound_queue` (thread messages) and
  the new queue table `intake_group_requests`; it reads the bot's
  `intake_groups` (group state) and `intake_inbound` (operator messages,
  read past a watermark kept in intake.db). The bot owns the schema of all
  three intake tables (`messaging/whatsapp/src/intake.ts`);
  `whatsapp_queue::open` creates the queue table only so a producer works
  before the bot booted.
- **Worktrees** live under `[intake] work_dir` (default `~/nucleus-work`),
  which must be outside the Nucleus checkout.

### 13. Configuration

`[intake]` in `nucleus.toml` (see `nucleus.toml.example`): `enabled`,
`work_dir`, `label`, `min_confidence`, `test_timeout_minutes`,
`[[intake.repos]]` (`repo`, `test_command`, `default_branch`,
`pr_issue_keyword`), `[intake.github]` (`gh_bin`, `poll_interval_secs`,
`collaborator_cache_secs`, `max_pages`), `[intake.whatsapp]`
(`refinement_groups`, `max_groups_per_day`, `group_wait_minutes`),
`[intake.texts]` (every operator-facing text). The repos name the
operator's projects and live only in the untracked file. The operator's
number for group creation is the first `WHATSAPP_ALLOWED_DM_JIDS` entry,
which must be a phone number.

## Threat model

The checks here are the ADR-033 ones (they decide what a caller may do
through the Nucleus CLIs; they are not isolation) plus:

- **Who starts work.** Only an issue with the label, which requires triage
  or write access on the repo. Removing the label cancels an item that has
  not reached the PR.
- **What an agent reads.** The issue text (fenced as data) and collaborator
  comments (fenced as data). Other comments never reach an agent.
- **What an agent can do.** Eval and refinement agents cannot run commands,
  edit files or use the web. The implementation agent edits and runs local
  commands in its worktree; the `code` profile refuses the ordinary network
  commands and web tools. A determined agent could still write a program
  that opens a socket, or edit files outside its worktree: that needs an OS
  sandbox, which the operator deferred. Because every network step is
  Nucleus code, adding a sandbox later means only denying the agent's
  process network and filesystem access outside the worktree.
- **What reaches the outside.** Nucleus pushes only the item's branch, opens
  only draft PRs, never merges, and posts a comment only after the operator
  approved its text; GitHub text passes the credential filter. WhatsApp
  messages go through the outbound queue (target policy, secret filter);
  intake groups are sendable only while active, and only through the drain
  (the TypeScript queue writers `ack.ts` and `enqueue-media.ts` still accept
  only configured groups).
- **Who approves.** Only an operator message read by code (the bot verified
  the sender is the operator, in the operator's DM or an intake group whose
  membership tripwire has not fired), the operator's terminal, or the
  dashboard (tailnet only). A chat session, a worker, or an agent message
  cannot approve.

## Verification

- Unit (Rust, `cargo test -p nucleus-core intake`): stage transitions
  (allowed and refused), eval parsing and escalation, plan extraction,
  operator commands, group budget, subjects and branch names; event dedup and
  validation, one item per event, guarded stage changes, thread dedup and
  read marks, collaborator cache; GitHub issue conversion and gate, poll
  cursor and state selection, collaborator filtering (404, other failures,
  cache), reply without double posting; git worktree / branch / commit /
  push cycle, test runs with status and timeout, work dir outside the
  checkout; brief fencing and size; the pipeline against a fake `gh`, a bare
  remote and a launcher that starts nothing: a simple issue to a draft PR and
  a posted comment, a feature refined in a group with refused and accepted
  approvals, dashboard replies, the group budget and fallbacks, the source
  stopping items, step retries and failure recovery, unknown items and
  duplicate messages, polling with the interval, item locks. Tasks: working
  directory and profile validation. CLI authorization. Dashboard: missing
  DBs, JSON-only and same-origin writes.
- Unit (TypeScript, `src/intake.test.ts`): group budget, DM routing by marker
  and by quoted message, inbound dedup, group creation with the operator only
  and within the budget, failure fallback without retry, leaving only after
  the last messages, intake groups in the target allowlist, `[[…]]` TOML.
- Web (`src/lib/intake.test.ts`): action availability per stage, stage
  colours, labels.
- End to end with real tmux + claude sessions (opt-in):
  `cargo test -p nucleus --test intake_pipeline_it -- --ignored --nocapture`
  runs `nucleus intake tick` against a fake `gh` (shell script) and a local
  bare remote: the eval (read-only) and implementation (code) agents run in
  `nucleus-test-intake`; the item reaches a draft PR with passing tests; the
  non-collaborator's comment is absent from every brief; the operator's
  comment approval posts exactly one comment; every thread message is queued
  for the DM with the `[#1]` marker.
- The first end-to-end runs found two defects in shared session code, both
  fixed with this ADR: transcript folder names replaced only `/` (Claude Code
  replaces every character that is not a letter or digit, so a worktree
  path with `_` or `.` broke typed-input verification), and the run-log was
  written under the session's working directory (a `memory/` folder
  appeared in the target repo and would have been committed). Sessions now
  take `state_root` for Nucleus's own files.
- Not verified here (needs the live environment): polling the real
  repositories with the operator's `gh` login, real draft PRs and comments,
  and WhatsApp group creation and leaving on the live account.

## Rejected alternatives

- **Webhooks.** They need public ingress, which Nucleus does not have
  ([[ADR-011]]); a poll every few minutes is fast enough for issues.
- **One long refinement session per item, resumed per turn.** A session's
  context lasts only as long as its transcript can be resumed; ADR-029
  removed ad hoc resume. The thread in intake.db is the durable record, so
  each turn's brief carries it.
- **Letting the refinement agent decide that a plan is approved.** Approval
  releases implementation work; a model reading "looks good" is not an
  authorization. Code reads a whole-message command from the operator, bound
  to a plan version. (ADR-033 rejected code-parsed commands for tasks
  because the model maps plain language well enough there; an approval gate
  is different.)
- **The implementation agent pushes and opens the PR.** It would need
  network access and the operator's `gh` credentials inside the session,
  which rules out a later sandbox.
- **A WhatsApp group for every item.** Simple items need no discussion, and
  automated group creation risks the account; groups exist only for items
  that reach refinement, within a daily limit.
- **Running the pipeline inside the WhatsApp bot or the dashboard.** Git,
  `gh` and test runs would block processes that must stay responsive, and
  intake.db would get a second writer family.

## Consequences

- A labeled issue on a configured repo starts an eval within a few minutes
  (the poll interval) and needs no operator action when it is simple, until
  the comment decision.
- The operator's WhatsApp gets up to `max_groups_per_day` new groups a day;
  each is left when its item closes. Items past the limit use the DM with
  `[#n]` markers.
- Each refinement turn re-reads the repository it needs, since it starts a
  new session; long threads are cut to their most recent part in the brief.
- Nucleus's own test run holds that item's lock for up to
  `test_timeout_minutes`; other items continue.
- The `code` profile is a denylist; until an OS sandbox exists, an
  implementation agent acts with the operator's user rights on the machine.
